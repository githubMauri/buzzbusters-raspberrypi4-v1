# Mosquito Detection and Monitoring System

## Description

The Mosquito Detection and Monitoring System is a solution developed to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases in the Santa Cruz region, Bolivia. The system utilizes image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect the density and distribution of mosquitoes in real-time, enabling early detection and prevention efforts.

The system includes a network of mosquito traps equipped with Raspberry Pi 4 for image capture and processing. The images are processed on the Raspberry Pi 4 and the results are sent to Firebase, where they are displayed on a dashboard accessible to healthcare professionals, local authorities, and the mobile application for citizens.

This project utilizes deep learning techniques for mosquito detection. The solution uses a camera and a detection algorithm to identify and count mosquitoes in real-time. The detection is performed using a model trained on Google Colab. The application runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 and utilizes Google cloud services such as Firebase for storage and visualization of the results.

The solution includes a mobile application for the public to report mosquito sightings and track the progress of mosquito control efforts in their area. It also provides information on symptoms and preventive measures. With this mobile application, we engage the community in mosquito control efforts and enhance the effectiveness of our solution.
